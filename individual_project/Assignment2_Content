Assignment 2
Part A

In the beginning, the program checks if a file named "Score.txt" in a specific location in your Google Drive contains any score or not?

If it does not contain any score, it shows the following message: "Welcome to your Math Game!"

If there is any recorded score, e.g. 30, the program shows the following message: "I am happy to meet you again! Your last score was 30!"

Next, the program randomly chooses two integer numbers and an operator, such as +, - or *. (You need to find a way how to generate random operator. It is not very difficault.)

For example, the program chooses 7, 8, and +. Then it asks the user the following question: "What is the result of 7 + 8?"

If the user enters a correct answer, the following message will show on the screen: "Congratulations! You are Pro!" And it adds one score to the user's achieved score.

And if the user enters a wrong answer, the following message will show on the screen: "The correct answer is 15. Let's try another question :)" And it reduces one score from the user's achieved score.

Then the program should ask you if you want to continue the game, showing the following text: "Do you want to continue? (Y to continue, any other character to Exit)"

In the following, I will guide you to enjoy your coding process, step by step:

# Define a global maxScore=0
# This variable will take care of number of correct and number of wrong answers


# Define a function, called  myMathTest that has the following parts:
# You need to callmaxScore here (your global variable) as you need to modify it 
# in this function.

# Define two random integers, e.g. variable a and variable b
# These two random integers are between 1 to 10.
# Imagine, in one run the random numbers for a, and b are 3 and 5 respectively.

# Define a mechanism that generates a random operator 
# (one of the following operators +, - or * )
# Imagine the random operator is *, so you need to calculate c=a*b
# Which would be c=3*5
#
# Now, you need to ask the user the following question:
# What is the result of 3*5?

# If the user enters 15, the following message should appear:
# "Congratulations! You are Pro!"
# And you need to add 1 to your global maxScore.

# If the user enters a wrong answer, e.g. 10, 
# the following message should appear:
# "The correct answer is 15. Let's try another question :)"
# And you need to deduct 1 from your global maxScore.

# Now, define an infinite loop (Hint: Using True as the condition) 
# and call myMathTest() as the first statement inside the loop.
# Then, every time ask the user if they want to continue playing or not, 
# asking the following question:
# "Do you want to continue? (Y to continue, any other character to Exit)"

# The game should continue as long as the user presses "y" or "Y".

# After the user entered any character, but "y" or "Y", 
# you should print the following messages:
# "Thank you for playing!"
# "You got XXX!"
# "WOW!"

# e.g. if the achieved score is 150, the messages would be as follows:
# "Thank you for playing!"
# "You got 150!"
# "WOW!"


Part B
# Now, you reviewed the Quadratic Equation concept.
# First, we type "Welcome to Quadratic Equation Game!"

# Next, please show the Quadratic Equation as follows:
# "aX^2 + bX + C = 0"

# Then, ask the user to enter a, b, and c, respectively.

# Now, please show the quadratic equation to the user, before start solving it:
# e.g. "Your Quadratic Equation is: 1X^2 + 5X + 6 = 0"

# Define a function, called discriminant that receives a, b, and c, and calculates the discriminant.

# Use the above function in the following part:
# If Discriminant is positive, we get two Real solutions.
# So, please print "We got two real solutions, which are X1, and X2"
# Sure, you calculate the value of X1, and X2.

# If Discriminant  is zero we get just ONE real solution (both answers are the same).
# So, please print "We got one real solution, which is X1"
# Sure, you calculate the value of X1.

# If Discriminant is negative we get a pair of Complex solutions.
# So, please print "The Discriminant is negative, we got a pair of Complex solutions."
# You do not need to show the complex solutions :)

# Note: You need to import math library, and calculate the square root of 
# discriminant for the case that you have two real solutions.

# Finally, save the above two messages into a file, called "QuadEqu.txt"
# e.g.
# Your Quadratic Equation is: 1X^2 + 5X + 6 = 0
# We got two real solutions,, which are -2.0, and -3.0
